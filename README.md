## Few simple requirements

- Send authorization request (POST) to http://playground.tesonet.lt/v1/tokens to generate token with body: `{"username": "tesonet", "password": "partyanimal"}`. (Don't forget Content-Type)
- Get servers list from http://playground.tesonet.lt/v1/servers. Add header to request: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- Design should be recreated as closely as possible
- Bonus: implement smooth animated transition from login through loader to server list screen
- Bonus: implement persistent storage of the downloaded server data
- Bonus: have a good set of unit tests

*Note:* The bonus requirements are optional. While they are nice to have, it's much more important to have the basics nailed.
